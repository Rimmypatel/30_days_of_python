SyntaxError



Example 1: SyntaxError


>>> print 'hello world'
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    print 'hello world'
                      ^
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print('hello world')?
>>>

As you can see we made a syntax error because we forgot to enclose the string with parenthesis and python is already suggested us to fix. Let's fix it.


>>> print 'hello world'
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    print 'hello world'
                      ^
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print('hello world')?
>>> print('hello world')
hello world
>>>

The error was a SyntaxError and we fixed and our code executed. Let see more error types.
