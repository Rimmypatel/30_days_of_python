IndexError

Example 1: IndexError

>>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> numbers[5]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range
>>>

In the above example, python raised an IndexError because the list has only 0 to 4 indexes, so it was out of range.
