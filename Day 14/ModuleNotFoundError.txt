ModuleNotFoundError

Example 1: ModuleNotFoundError

>>> import maths
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'maths'
>>>

In the above example, I added extra s to math deliberately and ModuleNotFoundError was raised. Lets fix the error by removing the extra added s from math.

>>> import maths
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'maths'
>>> import math
>>>

We fixed the error by removing the extra s. Now let's use some of the function from math module.
